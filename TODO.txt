There's a case, possibly an unusual one, where a cockroach was stuck behind a plant. I sat there waiting for the cockroach to come to me. Eventually it killed the plant and things continued, but it took a silly amount of time (because cockroaches take a silly amount of time to kill plants).

I'm not really sure what the "correct" course of action is to take in this case. For now it's not a hard blocker, but I'm sure this will come up again with transparent walls...
